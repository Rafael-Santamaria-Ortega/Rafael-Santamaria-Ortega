🧙‍♂️ Greetings, I’m Rafael Santamaría Ortega.

👨‍💻 I am a Cyber Defense Analyst with a unique background in philosophy and communications, **actively looking for a job in cybersecurity**. With a Summa Cum Laude M.A. in Philosophy, I’ve honed critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and analytical problem-solving skills, which are essential for tackling complex and ever-evolving cybersecurity challenges. My 3+ years in digital marketing have also equipped me with transferable expertise in managing reputational risks, implementing IAM policies, and conveying technical concepts to diverse audiences.

🛡️ I’m passionate about leveraging my interdisciplinary knowledge to deconstruct complex threats, prioritize risks, and design innovative solutions to protect people and organizations. I’ve gained hands-on experience in tools like Splunk, OpenVAS, Wireshark, Nmap, and Suricata, and I’m proficient in scripting cybersecurity automations using Python.

👨‍🎓 I’m continually expanding my skillset with practical projects, such as building an IDS/firewall using Raspberry Pi and creating a vulnerability scanner powered by Nmap and Scapy. My technical expertise spans cybersecurity frameworks like NIST CSF and MITRE ATT&CK, incident response, and AI applications for threat detection.

🧠 I thrive in complex new environments, adapting quickly to perform effectively by leveraging my critical thinking, analytical abilities and problem-solving skills. My ultimate goal is to protect not just systems, but the people and communities they serve.
